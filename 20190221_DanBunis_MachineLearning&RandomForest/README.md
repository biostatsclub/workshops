# Machine Learning: Where did this Random Forest come from?

In this session, I'll give an overview of machine learning techniques in general, with an ultimate focus on the random forest method of machine learning.

In the first part of the coding section, we will be working with the randomForest package, so you will need to have that downloaded if you would like to follow along.

In the second half of the coding section, as long as time permits, I'll mix together a tutorial of, [DittoSeq](https://github.com/dtm2451/DittoSeq), my new scRNAseq visualization package, with how I personally used random forest in my scRNAseq project.

DittoSeq is a package that I have been writing in order to make scRNAseq analysis more accessible to novice coders & color-blind indidivuals (like myself).  Downloading this package will be purely optional for my session, though I do hope you will find it useful and give it a try!

## Installation Instructions

```
#randomForest
install.packages("randomForest")

#OPTIONAL: DittoSeq
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dtm2451/DittoSeq")
```
