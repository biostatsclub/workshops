In this session, I'll give an overview of machine learning techniques in general, and then go into a bit more depth about random forest methods.

In the coding section, I'll use the caret package for model building, [example single cell RNAseq data](example.rds), and my own package [RNAseqPlotR](https://github.com/dtm2451/RNAseqPlotR) for visualization of the results.

The major goal will be to teach about machine learning, but I also do want to focus a fair amount on my RNAseqPlotR (name-not-finalized =p) package.  It's a package that I have been writing in order to make scRNAseq analysis more accessible to novice coders & color-blind indidivuals like myself.
