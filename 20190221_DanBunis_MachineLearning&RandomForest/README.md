In this session, I'll give an overview of machine learning techniques in general, with an ultimate focus on the random forest method of machine learning.

The major goal will be to teach about machine learning, but as long as time permits, I will also give an overview of my scRNAseq package that I have been downloading tentatively called [DittoSeq](https://github.com/dtm2451/DittoSeq).  It's a package that I have been writing in order to make scRNAseq analysis more accessible to novice coders & color-blind indidivuals (like myself).  As of this week, the package can be installed with the code `devtools::install_github("dtm2451/DittoSeq")`.  Downloading this package will be purely optional for my session, though I do hope you will find it useful and give it a try!
